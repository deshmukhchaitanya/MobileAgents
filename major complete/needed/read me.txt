--> Implementation of mobile agents with a base station and two other nodes.
   But can be extended for any no. of nodes.

-->Uses retrieve and count as eg. tasks. 1st one retrieves a specified file(E:\test)
   from given destination ip's(192.168.1.6) and the 2nd one counts and displays the folders
   and files in a specified folder(D:/Mp3).These both work in windows and need to change
   paths in them to search or count in any other folder than specified. 

-->Still a lot of scope of improvement in GUI.

-->Can change the task by using new valuse of 'op' variable in the coding of 
   Home page, and transfering it instead of our eg. task's '.class' file.
   This just needs new task's '.class' file.

-->Needs a pre-made empty output.txt file in home directory.
